It is a clone of the old arcade game Rampart. Up to four players
(or more in future versions) build castle walls,
place cannons inside these walls, and shoot at the walls
of their enemy(s). If a player cannot build a complete wall
around one of his castles, he loses. The last surviving player wins.
