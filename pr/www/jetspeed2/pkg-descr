Jetspeed is an Open Source implementation of an Enterprise
Information Portal, using Java and XML. A portal makes network
resources (applications, databases and so forth) available to
end-users. The user can access the portal via a web browser,
WAP-phone, pager or any other device. Jetspeed acts as the central
hub where information from multiple sources are made available in
an easy to use manner.
