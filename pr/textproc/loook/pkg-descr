Loook is a simple Python tool that searches for text strings in OpenOffice.org
(and StarOffice 6.0 or later) files.
It works under FreeBSD, Linux, Windows and Macintosh.
AND, OR and phrase searches are supported. It doesn't create an index,
but searching should be fast enough unless you have really many files.
