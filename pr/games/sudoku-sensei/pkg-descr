From the beginning, Sudoku Sensei was intended to become a program with
Graphical User Interface. Though, the first versions were just the core of that:
a sudoku logic explainer engine. That is, a library capable of solving sudokus
just like humans do.

The engine solves sudokus by applying complex logical rules a few times,
instead of applying simpler rules (like guessing and backtracking) many many
times. These complex logical rules are exactly the same ones that people use
with paper and pen.
