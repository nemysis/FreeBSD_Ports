Bombz is a simple 2D puzzle game. It doesn't really have a plot. The object is
to blow up all the bombs on each level then escape off the edge of the screen.
To blow up a bomb, push it to where you want to cause an explosion, then collect
a match (originally a detonator in the Archimedes version) and touch the bomb
again and quickly get out of the way. A bomb destroys everything surrounding it
except the metallic walls; if it blows up another bomb, that takes out
everything around it too so you can set off chain reactions.

I originally wrote Bombz for the Acorn Archimedes over ten years ago and this is
a complete rewrite with better graphics and sound etc. I chose to keep the
original frame rate of 50fps in the rewrite because a more conventional 60fps
feels a little too fast and 30fps feels too slow. Movement may appear slightly
jerky unless your monitor runs at 100Hz.
