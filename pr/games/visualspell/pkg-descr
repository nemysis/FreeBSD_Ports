Visual Spell. The objective of this program is to improve the spelling, reading,
and vocabulary skills of English speaking children in the age 6-10.
However, all ages may find it enjoyable.

Reasoning Skills and Vocabulary. The program challenges players to use reasoning
skills to match a word from their existing vocabulary that best represents
a pictorial scenario. This pictorial scenario or visual puzzle not only is
connected in some way to a designated word but also has the spelling of that
specific word hidden or buried within the very picture. Consequently, students
can get clues as to what letters may be present in the designated word.
This also contains a visual spatial aspect as the letters are rotated 90 degrees
with respect to their orientation inside the puzzle. If the student can not
figure out the spelling of the word from this initial pictorial scenario,
then additional verbal and visual clues are sequentially provided
at different degrees. Subsequently, every puzzles solution will eventually
be revealed and the student prompted to practice typing the spelling of that
particular solution.
