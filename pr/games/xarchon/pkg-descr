XArchon is a chess-like strategy game with battle options.

It is modelled after the golden oldie Archon game created by
Freefall Associates and distributed by Electronic Arts around 1985.

In this game, the Light Side and Dark Side fight over control of a
chess-like board. Each side is composed of 18 fantastic creatures of
myth and legend, which are represented by images (or icons). While not
identical, the opposing sides are balanced in strength.
