GLFW is a free, Open Source, portable library for OpenGL and OpenGL ES
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows and contexts, reading input, handling events, etc.

Version 3.0 brings a new API with many new features such as multiple windows
and contexts, multi-monitor support, EGL and OpenGL ES support, clipboard text
support, an error description callback, gamma ramp control, layout-independent
keyboard input and UTF-8 for all strings.
