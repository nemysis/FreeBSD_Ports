pyglet provides an object-oriented programming interface for developing games
and other visually-rich applications.

Some of the features of pyglet are:

 * No external dependencies or installation requirements. For most application
    and game requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides Python, simplifying
    distribution and installation.
 * Take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor desktops. pyglet allows
    you to use as many windows as you need, and is fully aware of multi-monitor
    setups for use with fullscreen games.
 * Load images, sound, music and video in almost any format. pyglet can
    optionally use AVbin to play back audio formats such as MP3, OGG/Vorbis and
    WMA, and video formats such as DivX, MPEG-2, H.264, WMV and Xvid.
