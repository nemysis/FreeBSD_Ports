Libav is a friendly and community-driven effort to provide its users with a set
of portable, functional and high-performance libraries for dealing with
multimedia formats of all sorts. It originates from the FFmpeg codebase,
but goes its own way these days, providing its users with reliable releases
and a clear vision how to go forward.
