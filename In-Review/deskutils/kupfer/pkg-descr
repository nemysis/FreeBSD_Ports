Kupfer is a GTK interface for quick and convenient access to applications
and their documents.

The most typical use is to find a specific application and launch it.
We have tried to make Kupfer easy to extend with plugins so that this
quick-access paradigm can be extended to many more objects than just
applications.

Kupfer is heavily inspired by Quicksilver. You can enable more Plugins,
but must have installed Applications which this Plugin needs.
