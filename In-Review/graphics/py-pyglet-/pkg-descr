pyglet provides an object-oriented programming interface for
developing games and other visually-rich applications for Windows,
Mac OS X and Linux. Some of the features of pyglet are:

 * No external dependencies or installation requirements. For most
   application and game requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides
   Python, simplifying distribution and installation.
 * Take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor desktops.
   pyglet allows you to use as many windows as you need, and is fully
   aware of multi-monitor setups for use with fullscreen games.
 * Load images, sound, music and video in almost any format. pyglet
   can optionally use AVbin to play back audio formats such as MP3,
   OGG/Vorbis and WMA, and video formats such as DivX, MPEG-2, H.264,
   WMV and Xvid.

pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license, allowing you
to use it for both commerical and other open-source projects with
very little restriction.
