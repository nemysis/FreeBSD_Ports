FreeBSD/amd64 users:
You need to manually install Wine 32bit binary from:
http://www.mediafire.com/wine_fbsd64

For more info about running Wine on FreeBSD please see:
http://wiki.freebsd.org/Wine

This program will attempt to obtain some system information by accessing files
in procfs, linprocfs and fdescfs. You must mount procfs, linprocfs and fdescfs
filesystem for this to work correctly.

This can be accomplished by adding the following lines to your /etc/fstab file:

# Device                Mountpoint      FStype  Options         Dump    Pass#
proc                    /proc           procfs  rw              0       0
linproc                 /compat/linux/proc      linprocfs       rw      0       0
fdescfs                 /dev/fd         fdescfs rw              0       0

and then, as root, executing the commands:

mount /proc
mount /compat/linux/proc
mount /dev/fd


Better is to use DOSBox for DOS Games.


When You deinstall PlayOnLinux, the games and software installed from within
PlayOnLinux are not removed.

Remove those games and software first, then remove PlayOnLinux itself.

Otherwise, reinstall PlayOnLinux and remove them using it
or do it manually by removing

    ~/.PlayOnLinux
