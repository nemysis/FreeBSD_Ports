PlayOnLinux is a piece of software which allows you to easily install and use
numerous games and apps designed to run with Microsoft Windows.
Few games are compatible with GNU/Linux at the moment and it certainly is a
factor preventing the migration to this system. PlayOnLinux brings a cost-free,
accessible and efficient solution to this problem.

PlayOnLinux is based on Wine, and so profits from all its features yet it keeps
the user from having to deal with its complexity.
PlayOnLinux uses Bash and Python.
