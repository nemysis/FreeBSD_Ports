pure-gen is a C interface generator for the Pure language. It takes a C
header file as input and generates a corresponding Pure module with the
constant definitions and extern declarations needed to use the C module
from Pure. pure-gen can also generate FFI interfaces rather than externs
(using the pure-ffi module, see below), and it can optionally create a C
wrapper module which allows you to create interfaces to pretty much any
code which can be called via C. Interfaces to C++ can be made using SWIG's
new C language module which can wrap arbitrary C++ libraries in C.
