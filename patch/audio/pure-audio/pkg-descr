pure-audio is a digital audio interface for the Pure programming language.
It currently includes wrappers for PortAudio, FFTW3, libsndfile and
libsamplerate, as well as a realtime module which gives Pure scripts access
to realtime scheduling on systems which have a pthreads library with the
POSIX realtime threads extension.
