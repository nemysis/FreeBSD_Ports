Video::Info is a factory class for working with video files. When you create
a new Video::Info object, something like this will happen:
   1) open file, determine type. See Video::Info::Magic.
   2) attempt to create object of appropriate class (ie, MPEG::Info for MPEG
      files, RIFF::Info for AVI files).
   3) Probe the file for various attributes
   4) return the created object, or a Video::Info object if the appropriate
      class is unavailable.
