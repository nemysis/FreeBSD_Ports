StreamAnalyze is a little helper for people using StreamDVD to backup movies.
Giving the video/audio/subpicture tracks you want to save, StreamAnalyze will
calculate if the backup would fit on a dvd-r and, if not, print a shrink
factor to reduce the video size.

Before using StreamAnalyze you should call 'lsdvd' or 'tcprobe' to get an
overview of what is available on the video DVD you want to backup.
